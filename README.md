Veil
One key. One light. No safe place in the Veil.

Veil is a top-down 2D horror escape game set in a shifting haunted mansion. You remain fixed at the center of the screen while rooms move around you — search the house for the single key and escape before the entities close in.

You're armed only with a flashlight that can stun an entity for 10 seconds. Batteries are scarce — use them wisely. Explore, listen, and outsmart hunters that stalk the dark.
